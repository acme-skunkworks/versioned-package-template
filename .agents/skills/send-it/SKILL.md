# send-it

Bundle uncommitted work into atomic commits (via the
[`commit`](../commit/SKILL.md) skill), run the change-gated lint
[`preflight`](../preflight/SKILL.md), author or update the dated
`changelog/<ts>-<slug>.md` entry (via the [`changelog`](../changelog/SKILL.md)
skill), compose a **Conventional Commits PR title** (the squash subject
release-please reads to decide the version bump), push the branch, open or update
a pull request against the base branch, and transition any linked Linear issues to
**In Review** (via the [`linear-sync`](../linear-sync/SKILL.md) skill).

This skill is the single source of truth for the **ship flow**. It is a thin
orchestrator: it owns only the glue no sibling skill does — the branch guard,
worktree resolution, the release-type decision (by category), PR-title
composition, push, and the PR — and delegates the rest:

- **Commit** → the `commit` skill (classify in-scope vs out-of-scope, atomic
  Conventional Commits, out-of-scope guard).
- **Lint gate** → the `preflight` skill (change-gated; no-ops when nothing
  lint-relevant changed).
- **Changelog** → the `changelog` skill (author/update + validate; an entry for
  **every** PR, skipped entirely only when `config.json` sets `changelog: false`).
- **Linear In Review** → the `linear-sync` skill (resolve state by team name,
  idempotent transition).

The delegated skills auto-detect their own scope, so monorepo features
(per-workspace ESLint fan-out, changelog `affected_packages`) no-op cleanly in a
single-package repo. send-it configures nothing about them.

> **Install the delegated skills alongside `send-it`.** This bundle invokes and
> links its siblings by relative path (`../commit/SKILL.md`, `../preflight/SKILL.md`,
> `../changelog/SKILL.md`, `../linear-sync/SKILL.md`), so a `--skill send-it`-only
> install leaves the commit, lint, changelog, and Linear steps unavailable and those
> links dangling. Install them together:
>
> ```bash
> npx skills add https://github.com/acme-skunkworks/agent-skills \
>   --skill send-it --skill commit --skill preflight --skill changelog --skill linear-sync \
>   --agent claude-code --agent cursor --copy
> ```

This flow intentionally does **not** run typecheck, tests, or format checks — CI
handles those. The only gate it runs is the change-gated `preflight` lint.

## Configuration

A few knobs live in [`config.json`](config.json) beside this file; edit your
copied `config.json` to match the consuming repo (a neutral
[`config.example.json`](config.example.json) ships as a template):

| Key | Meaning | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `baseBranch` | The trunk the branch diff is taken against (`origin/<baseBranch>`) and the PR base. | `"main"` |
| `shippablePaths` *(advisory)* | Path prefixes that make up the published surface — a documentation hint for reviewers, **not** the release decision (A-598; see Step 6). Release-type is decided by the change's semantic category, so these no longer gate the title. Kept for the optional publish-surface cross-check note. | `["skills/"]` |
| `shippableManifestKeys` *(advisory)* | `package.json` keys that form the published-`files` surface — same advisory role as `shippablePaths`, no longer a release gate. | `["name", "version", "files", "publishConfig"]` |
| `changelog` *(optional)* | Whether to author a dated `changelog/` entry at all (Steps 7–8). Set `false` for repos with **no changelog flow** — no `changelog/` directory and no `changelog` skill installed (e.g. a `private` repo with no release pipeline). When `false`, send-it skips changelog authoring entirely, and the category decision continues to drive only the PR title. **Omit it (or set `true`) whenever the `changelog` skill is installed.** | `true` |
| `bundleVersioning` *(optional)* | Enables the per-bundle version-bump check (Step 6) for repos that ship many independently-versioned skill bundles. An object `{ root, manifest, skillFile }` naming the bundle parent dir and the manifest / skill-manifest filenames each bundle carries. **Omit it entirely in single-package repos** — the check then no-ops. | unset (disabled) |

The team name, issue-ID prefixes, and workspace slug are **not** configured here —
they live in the `linear-sync` and `changelog` skills' own `config.json` files,
read by the delegated steps.

> **Changelog scope (was `changelogScope`).** send-it authors a dated entry for
> **every** PR — the "record everything, filter later" model. Release notes come
> from filtering the changelog to the version-stamped (release-triggering) entries
> at release time, not from gating authoring at write time. The `changelogScope`
> knob (added in 0.4.0) is **gone** (A-600); only the `changelog: true|false`
> master switch remains.

## Prerequisites

- `gh` CLI installed and authenticated (`gh auth status`).
- The sibling skills (`commit`, `preflight`, `changelog`, `linear-sync`) installed.

## Process

### Step 0: Worktree resolution (only if `--worktree=` is set)

If `--worktree=<branch-or-path>` was passed, resolve and `cd` into that worktree
before any other step runs. Skip this step otherwise.

1. Run `git worktree list --porcelain` to list worktrees with their paths and
   branches.
2. Resolve the argument:
   - **Absolute path** (starts with `/`): match against the `worktree <path>`
     field.
   - **Otherwise**: treat as a branch name and match against the
     `branch refs/heads/<name>` field.
3. **No match** — exit immediately with: `No worktree found for <arg>. Available:
   <comma-separated paths>`.
4. **Match** — `cd` into the resolved worktree path. The `cwd` persists for the
   rest of the workflow, so all subsequent `git` and `gh` calls operate on the
   worktree.
5. **Ensure dependencies are present.** A freshly-created worktree has no
   `node_modules`. If it is absent, run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` now —
   before any step that invokes a bundled script or a validator — so `--worktree`
   is self-sufficient:

   ```bash
   [ -d node_modules ] || pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
   ```

6. Continue to Step 1.

This step does nothing when `--worktree` is omitted — no-arg send-it keeps working
unchanged from whatever directory the session is in.

### Step 1: Branch guard

1. Get the current branch: `git branch --show-current`.
2. **If on the base branch** (`baseBranch` from `config.json`; default `main`):
   - Run `git status --porcelain`. If clean, exit with: "Nothing to ship from the
     base branch. Create a feature branch first."
   - If there are uncommitted changes:
     - Inspect the diff (`git diff` and `git diff --cached`) and the changed file
       paths.
     - Derive a short kebab-case slug summarising the change (~3 words, lowercase,
       max ~40 chars). Examples: `add-readme-section`, `fix-config-typo`.
     - **Branch name resolution (in order):**
       1. `--branch=<name>` — use as-is.
       2. `--issue=<ID>` — use `<ID>-<slug>` **lower-cased** (e.g.
          `a-7-as-acquired`), matching Linear's `gitBranchName`.
       3. Otherwise — just `<slug>` (no `wip/` prefix).
     - If the chosen branch already exists locally or on `origin`, append `-2`,
       `-3`, … until unused.
     - Run `git checkout -b <branch>` to move the working tree onto it.
     - Inform the user: "Was on the base branch with uncommitted changes; created
       `<branch>` and continuing."
   - Continue with the rest of the workflow on the new branch.
3. **If on a feature branch:** continue.

### Step 2: Refresh lockfile if `package.json` drifted

Skip this step if no `package.json` was touched on the branch.

1. `git diff --name-only origin/<base>...HEAD | grep -E '(^|/)package\.json$'`. If
   empty, skip.
2. Run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`. If it succeeds, the lockfile is already in
   sync — continue.
3. If it fails, run `pnpm install` to update the lockfile.
4. If the lockfile changed, stage and commit it before any other commits go in:

   ```bash
   git add pnpm-lock.yaml
   git commit -m "chore: update lockfile"
   ```

This keeps CI's `--frozen-lockfile` install green. (Skip silently in repos that
don't use pnpm.)

### Step 3: Commit uncommitted changes — delegate to the `commit` skill

send-it is the all-in-one finisher: whatever's uncommitted should be committed
before the changelog/PR work begins — but only what belongs to *this* branch.

Follow the [`commit`](../commit/SKILL.md) skill to do this: classify uncommitted
files **in-scope vs out-of-scope** against the merge base (`git merge-base HEAD
origin/<base>`), show a staging plan flagging any out-of-scope files (never `git
add -A`; stray files from another branch/worktree are never staged silently), and
create **logical atomic Conventional Commits** (type + optional scope +
British-English body; `!` / `BREAKING CHANGE:` for breaking changes). If clean,
skip this step. Direct the `commit` skill to classify against **this** send-it
run's resolved base — `<base>` is `baseBranch` (from `config.json`), or `--base`
when passed — **not** the `commit` skill's own `config.json` `baseBranch`, which
differs on a `--base` run (the stacked-PR case). The scope classification and the
out-of-scope guard must be computed against the same base send-it ships against,
or a stacked PR would mis-classify files.

The Conventional-Commit types this step writes are the input to Step 6's release
decision (`derive-bump.mjs` reads them back out of the commits), so the honest
types and `!` / `BREAKING CHANGE:` markers matter.

This delegation covers only the *initial* commit of uncommitted work. send-it's own
later, targeted commits stay here: the lockfile refresh (Step 2), the optional
bundle-version bump (Step 6), and the changelog entry (Step 8).

### Step 4: Fetch the base branch and confirm there's something to ship

```bash
git fetch origin <base>
```

If `git log origin/<base>..HEAD` is empty, exit with: "No commits ahead of the base
branch. Nothing to ship."

### Step 5: Lint gate — delegate to the `preflight` skill

> **`--skip-preflight`** bypasses this whole step. Print a clear
> `⚠️ lint gate bypassed (--skip-preflight)` warning and jump to Step 6. Use it only
> when the gate misfires; CI still runs the repo's real linting.

Run the change-gated lint preflight, following the [`preflight`](../preflight/SKILL.md)
skill:

```bash
node skills/preflight/scripts/preflight.mjs
```

Act on its exit-code contract, reading `.preflight-summary.json` to interpret a
non-zero exit:

- **Exit 0 — pass.** No introduced violations; continue.
- **Exit 1 with `violations.introducedCount > 0` — introduced violations
  (blocking).** Run `node skills/preflight/scripts/lint-fix.mjs`, re-run preflight,
  and repeat until introduced violations clear. Commit the fixes (a `style:`/`fix:`
  commit, or fold into the relevant Step 3 commit if not yet pushed) before
  continuing.
- **Exit 1 with `introducedCount == 0` and `results.failedLinters` non-empty — a
  linter could not run (its binary is absent), not a real violation.** This is
  expected in a repo that doesn't use that toolchain (e.g. a docs/skills repo with
  no ESLint or markdownlint installed). Treat it as a **skip, not a block**: warn
  that `<linter>` was unavailable and continue. The repo's own CI owns whatever
  linting it actually runs.
- **Exit 2 — pre-existing violations only.** Not introduced by this branch — do not
  block shipping. Surface them and continue (optionally offer a debt issue per the
  preflight skill).

Preflight is **change-gated**: it lints only the categories the branch touched, so
it no-ops when nothing lint-relevant changed. Skip this step entirely only if
`preflight` isn't installed.

### Step 6: Decide release-type by category and compose the Conventional Commits PR title

Versioning is driven by [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please)
reading **Conventional Commits**. The repo squash-merges, so the **squash subject is
the PR title** — and that single conventional title is what release-please parses to
decide the bump. send-it composes a correct conventional title and writes the dated
changelog entry (for every PR — see Step 7). It does **not** bump versions, write any
`CHANGELOG.md`, or tag.

Release-type is decided by the change's **semantic category — the Conventional-Commit
type of the work send-it itself committed — not by which paths the diff touches**
(A-598). A docs-only edit is `docs:` (no release) even when it lives under a published
path like `skills/`; a `feat:` is a release wherever its files sit. (Earlier versions
keyed this off `shippablePaths`, which mis-titled a docs edit inside a published path
as `feat:`/`fix:` and cut a spurious release.)

1. **Derive the slug, body, type, and category** from the branch commits via the
   bundled helper (zero-dep — no tsx):

   ```bash
   node skills/send-it/scripts/derive-bump.mjs
   ```

   It prints JSON:
   `{ "slug", "bump", "body", "type", "breaking", "category", "releaseTriggering" }`:
   - `type` — the Conventional-Commit type of the **lead commit** (`feat`/`fix`/`perf`/
     `docs`/`refactor`/`chore`/`ci`/…); this is the PR-title prefix.
   - `breaking` — `true` if any commit carries a `!` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` trailer.
   - `category` — the dated changelog `category` enum value (`feat`→`feature`,
     `fix`→`fix`, `perf`→`perf`, `docs`→`docs`, `refactor`→`refactor`, everything else
     →`chore`).
   - `releaseTriggering` — `true` iff `breaking` or `type ∈ {feat, fix, perf}`. This is
     the release decision: `true` cuts a release, `false` does not.
   - `bump` — `major`/`minor`/`patch`, the release **magnitude** when `releaseTriggering`
     (a `BREAKING CHANGE:`/`!` → major; lead `feat:` → minor; else patch). Ignored when
     `releaseTriggering` is `false`.

2. **(Advisory) publish-surface cross-check.** `shippablePaths` /
   `shippableManifestKeys` in [`config.json`](config.json) are a documentation hint of
   the published surface — they **do not** decide release-type any more. Optionally
   sanity-check the category against them: if `releaseTriggering` is `true` but the diff
   (`git diff --name-only origin/<base>...HEAD`) touches **no** `shippablePaths` prefix
   (nor a `shippableManifestKeys` key in `package.json`), note it in the PR body so a
   reviewer can confirm the release was intended — and likewise if a change touching a
   published path is `releaseTriggering: false`. This is a soft note only; never let it
   override the category decision or block.

3. **Check per-bundle version bumps** — only when `config.json` sets
   `bundleVersioning` (multi-artefact repos; skip this step entirely when it's
   unset). Each skill bundle carries its own version in its `package.json` +
   `SKILL.md metadata.version`, bumped by hand and decoupled from the repo release.
   CI enforces that the two **agree**, but nothing enforces they were **bumped** when
   the bundle's content changed — so an edited bundle can ship with a stale version
   label. Close that gap:

   ```bash
   node skills/send-it/scripts/check-skill-bumps.mjs
   ```

   It prints `{ "configured", "unbumped": [{ name, currentVersion, suggestedBump,
   suggestedVersion, manifestPath, skillPath }], "bumped" }`. For **each** `unbumped`
   entry, surface the proposal and apply it on confirmation:

   > `skills/<name>` changed but its version is still `<currentVersion>`. Suggested
   > bump: `<suggestedBump>` → `<suggestedVersion>` (matches the PR-title bump).
   > Apply? (yes / no / patch / minor / major)

   On `yes` (or an explicit level), edit **both** `manifestPath` (`version`) and
   `skillPath` (`metadata.version`) to the chosen version — in lockstep, so the
   parity invariant CI checks still holds — then stage and commit just those two
   files: `git commit -m "chore(<name>): release <name>@<version>"`. On `no`, leave
   it and continue. Under `--dry-run`, print the proposal and edit nothing.

4. **Compose the PR title** as a single Conventional Commits subject — this is the
   release-please bump signal and is enforced by CI's PR-title lint. If `--title` was
   passed, use it verbatim (still run `derive-bump` above for the changelog
   `category`, and **warn** — don't block — if the supplied type contradicts the
   derived `type`/`releaseTriggering`). Otherwise build it straight from the derived
   fields:
   - **Prefix** = `type` (add a scope when one is obvious, e.g. `feat(<scope>):`), plus
     `!` when `breaking` — so `feat: <body>`, `fix: <body>`, `perf: <body>`,
     `docs: <body>`, `refactor: <body>`, `chore: <body>`, `feat!: <body>`, etc.
   - **Release-triggering** (`releaseTriggering: true`) → the prefix is already a
     release type (`feat`/`fix`/`perf`, or any `!`); release-please cuts the bump from
     it. Add the scope; that's it.
   - **Non-release** (`releaseTriggering: false`) → the prefix is a non-release type
     (`docs`/`refactor`/`chore`/`ci`/`build`/`test`/`style`); release-please cuts
     nothing.

   > ⚠️ **The PR title is the version.** A mistyped prefix silently ships the wrong
   > semver — a `feat:` on a docs PR cuts a needless release; a `chore:` on a real
   > fix ships nothing. There is no changeset file to cross-check against: the title
   > **is** the declaration. It comes straight from the change's semantic category
   > (the commit types) — keep the commit types honest and the title follows.

   When `releaseTriggering` is `false`, note `no release (<type>-only)` in the PR body
   so reviewers can confirm the non-release type was intentional.

### Step 7: Author or update the dated changelog entry — delegate to the `changelog` skill

> **Disabled entirely?** If `config.json` sets `changelog: false`, **skip Steps 7
> and 8 completely** — author nothing, run no `changelog` scripts, make no
> `docs(changelog)` commit — and note "changelog step disabled (no changelog flow in
> this repo)" in the run summary. This is for repos with no `changelog/` directory and
> no `changelog` skill installed; the category decision from Step 6 still drives the PR
> title. When `changelog` is unset or `true`, **always author an entry** (the
> `changelogScope` knob was removed — A-600).
>
> **An entry for every PR.** send-it authors a dated `changelog/` entry for **every**
> PR, release-triggering or not — the "record everything, filter later" model. The
> dated changelog is the full record of merged work; release notes filter it to the
> version-stamped (release-triggering) entries at release time, so a non-release entry
> simply carries no `version`. `changelog: false` is the only thing that suppresses
> authoring.

Follow the [`changelog`](../changelog/SKILL.md) skill to author or update the entry:

1. Detect an existing entry for this branch (by the `branch` frontmatter field) →
   update vs create. On update, preserve the filename and `created_at`.
2. Write/refresh `changelog/<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>-<slug>.md` (the `<slug>` from Step 6),
   deriving `title`/`release_note`/`issues` from the branch. Set `category` and
   `breaking` straight from `derive-bump`'s output (Step 6): `category` is its
   `category` field (`feature`/`fix`/`perf`/`docs`/`refactor`/`chore` — the changelog
   enum), and `breaking` is its `breaking` flag. For a non-release entry
   (`releaseTriggering: false`), `release_note` may be blank when there's no
   user-facing impact.

   Leave the post-merge fields (`merged_at`, `commit`, `pr`, `merge_strategy`, `stats`)
   and `version` as blank placeholders — the release step finalises them (a non-release
   entry keeps `version` blank, as no release is cut for it). This includes `pr`: no
   step here writes it back after the PR opens; the release/enrich step resolves it
   post-merge from the entry's `branch:`.
3. Run the enrichment scripts: `node skills/changelog/scripts/set-affected-packages.mjs`
   then `node skills/changelog/scripts/add-links.mjs`.
4. **Validate:** `node skills/changelog/scripts/validate-changelog.mjs`. It must pass
   before committing — if it fails, surface the error and abort; don't auto-fix.

### Step 8: Commit the changelog entry and push

If a `changelog/` entry was written in Step 7 (i.e. `changelog` is not `false`), commit
only that file:

```bash
git add changelog/<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>-<slug>.md
git commit -m "docs(changelog): <one-line summary>"
```

Then push the branch:

```bash
git push -u origin <branch>
```

### Step 9: Create or update the PR

`<title>` is the Conventional Commits PR title from Step 6 — release-please reads it
as the squash subject, so set it on **both** create and update (re-derive it every
run so it stays in sync with the branch's commits).

1. Check for an existing PR: `gh pr view --json number,url 2>/dev/null`.
2. **If creating:** `gh pr create --base <base> --draft --title "<title>" --body
   "<body>"`. Use `--ready` (the flag) instead of `--draft` if the user passed
   `--ready`.
3. **If updating:** `gh pr edit <number> --title "<title>" --body "<body>"`.
4. **If `--merge-when-ready` was passed:** after create/update, run `gh pr merge
   --auto --squash <number>` to enable auto-merge once requirements are met.
5. Return the PR URL via `gh pr view --json url -q '.url'`.

**PR body template:**

```markdown
## Summary

- Comprehensive summary of all changes on this branch
- What changed and why

## Related Issues

<!-- Linear identifiers extracted from the branch and commits -->
- <ISSUE-ID>

## Test Plan

- [ ] <test>
```

Drop the `## Related Issues` section if no issues were found.

### Step 10: Transition linked Linear issues to In Review — delegate to the `linear-sync` skill

Follow the [`linear-sync`](../linear-sync/SKILL.md) skill with target state **In
Review**: read its `config.json` for `linearTeamName` and `issueKeys`, extract issue
IDs from the branch and commits, resolve the live state ID by team **name** (once),
and apply the transition idempotently (skip any issue already at or past In Review).
Skip silently if `linear-sync` or the Linear MCP server is unavailable.

## Flags

- `--dry-run` — print what would be written/submitted (changelog preview, branch,
  conventional PR title, any version-bump proposals), make no commits, no push, no
  `gh` calls. Exit 0.
- `--branch=<name>` — override the auto-derived branch name when running on the base
  branch with uncommitted changes.
- `--issue=<ID>` — prefix the auto-derived slug with a Linear issue ID (e.g.
  `--issue=A-7` → `a-7-<slug>`, lower-cased). Ignored if `--branch` is given.
- `--base=<branch>` — override `config.json`'s `baseBranch` for this run. Applies
  everywhere the base is used: the `git fetch`, the branch diff
  (`origin/<base>...HEAD`), the PR `--base`, and the `BASE_REF=origin/<branch>` env
  passed to `derive-bump.mjs` / `check-skill-bumps.mjs`. Use it for stacked PRs or a
  non-`main` target.
- `--title="<conventional subject>"` — set the PR title verbatim instead of deriving
  it (escape hatch for when derivation picks the wrong type). It must still be a valid
  Conventional Commits subject (CI lints it). `derive-bump` still runs (its `category`
  drives the changelog entry); send-it **warns** if the supplied type contradicts the
  derived `type`/`releaseTriggering`.
- `--skip-preflight` — skip the Step 5 lint gate entirely, printing a bypass warning.
- `--ready` — open the PR ready-for-review instead of draft (default is draft).
- `--merge-when-ready` — after create/update, enable `gh pr merge --auto --squash`.
- `--worktree=<branch-or-path>` — `cd` into a worktree before running (Step 0).

## Notes

- **Prose follows the host repo's language convention.** Author the PR title, PR
  body, and commit messages in the consuming repo's documented prose language. Across
  this estate that is **British English** (`colour`, `behaviour`, `-ise`/`-yse`); the
  `changelog` skill applies the same rule to the entry it writes. This governs prose
  only — never identifiers, dependency names, or upstream API field names.
- **Trunk-based:** PRs target the base branch (`config.json` `baseBranch`, or
  `--base` for this run).
- **send-it bumps only per-bundle versions, never the repo version.** The optional
  Step 6 bundle-version check moves a changed skill's own `metadata.version`; the
  repo-level npm release stays owned by release-please via the PR title.
- **Idempotent:** re-running send-it updates the existing PR title and changelog
  entry; the Linear writeback skips issues already In Review or beyond.
- **send-it does not bump versions or write any `CHANGELOG.md`.** release-please
  reads the merged Conventional-Commit PR title, bumps the manifest in the release
  PR, and the release workflow publishes + tags. send-it only writes the dated
  `changelog/<ts>-<slug>.md` entry (Step 7), finalised at release.

## Error Handling

- **`gh auth status` fails** — run `gh auth login` first; abort until authenticated.
- **changelog validation fails** — surface the error; don't auto-fix. The user
  resolves the entry and re-runs.
- **No commits ahead of the base** — exit "No commits ahead of the base branch.
  Nothing to ship."
- **Branch push fails** — verify push access; ensure the remote is configured.
- **PR create/update fails** — verify the PR isn't closed; verify the branch is
  pushed.
