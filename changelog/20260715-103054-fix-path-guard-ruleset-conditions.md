title: Send non-null conditions on the path-guard push ruleset
release_note: The initialise-versioned-repo skill now creates the "Changelog write-back path guard" ruleset successfully instead of failing with an HTTP 422.

## Fixed

- `pathGuardRulesetPayload()` built the **`Changelog write-back path guard`** push
  ruleset with `conditions: null`, which GitHub's repository-ruleset API rejects
  with HTTP 422 (`Invalid property /conditions: data cannot be null`). The third
  ruleset therefore never got created in a spawned repo — the skill reported the
  op as an error and the write-back path guard was silently missing. A repo-level
  push ruleset requires a `conditions` object; send `conditions: {}` so the
  file-path restriction applies to all pushes. The `.agents/` mirror is updated in
  lockstep (byte-parity guard) and the unit test that codified the old `null` now
  asserts `{}`. Surfaced while initialising the first spawned deploy target,
  csc-minutes ([A-930](https://linear.app/acme-skunkworks/issue/A-930)).
