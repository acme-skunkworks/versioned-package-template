## Changed

- Float `.github/workflows/changelog-enrich.yml` reusable caller from the [A-821](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-821)
  merge SHA pin to `acme-skunkworks/shared-workflows/.github/workflows/reusable-changelog-enrich.yml@v1`
  ([A-1365](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-1365)), matching the
  `octavo` / `shared-workflows` exemplars now that `@v1` includes the enrich
  workflow.
