# Changelog

One Markdown file per change, capturing what changed and why. Entries are written by the `/send-it` slash command at PR-creation time; the post-merge fields are filled in-repo by the `changelog-enrich` workflow after merge.

This is the curated, per-change, machine-readable record — and, since the move to release-please (which runs with `skip-changelog`, A-371), the **only** changelog in the repo: there is no root `CHANGELOG.md`. This repository is a **versioned, non-npm deploy target**: it publishes no npm or GitHub package — the release-orchestrator runs release-please to open the release PR and cuts the git **tag + GitHub Release**, sourcing the release notes from these dated entries. Release-triggering entries (`feature` / `fix` / `perf`, or any breaking change) carry the `version` they shipped in; non-release entries stay versionless.

## File naming

```text
changelog/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<slug>.md
```

- Timestamp is UTC and matches `created_at` in the frontmatter.
- Slug: lowercase, non-alphanumerics replaced with `-`, repeats collapsed, ~60-char cap on a word boundary.

## Frontmatter schema

```yaml

### Relationship to octavo's schema

This repository is the same archetype as `octavo` — a single, repo-level-versioned deploy target, not a monorepo — so the schema tracks octavo's closely, with one simplification:

- **`affected_packages` removed.** There is only one component, so entries carry no per-package affected list.

`version` records the repo-level release an entry shipped in (`X.Y.Z`, no leading `v`); it is filled when release-please cuts the release and stays blank on non-releasing entries.

### Required fields

`title`, `created_at`, `category`, `breaking`.

Everything else is validated _by type when present_ but not required. This lets two kinds of entry both validate:

- **Backfilled historical entries**, which have no `branch` / `author` / `stats`.
- **In-flight entries**, which have no `version` / `merged_at` / `pr` / `commit` / `stats` until they are enriched.

`/send-it` is the guarantee that new entries get `branch` / `author` / `co_authors`; validation is the safety net, not the sole guard.

> **Note on timestamps:** wrap ISO 8601 timestamps in quotes (`"2026-05-23T14:55:37Z"`). Unquoted timestamps are auto-parsed by YAML into Date objects, which round-trip with millisecond noise on enrichment. Quoting keeps them as exact strings.

### Categories

| Category   | When to use                                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `feature`  | New user-facing capability                      |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                                         |
| `chore`    | Tooling, build, dependency bumps                |
| `docs`     | Documentation-only change                       |
| `refactor` | Internal restructuring with no behaviour change |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                         |

If `breaking: true`, the body MUST contain a `## Breaking` section first, describing the change and the migration path.

## Body structure

```markdown
## Breaking <!-- only when breaking: true -->

Only include `Added` / `Changed` / `Fixed` headings that have entries.

## Lifecycle

Two stages — post-merge enrichment runs in-repo via `reusable-changelog-enrich.yml`
on every push to `main` (A-944; following A-796 / A-821):

1. **Create or update an entry (PR-time):** run `/send-it` from a feature branch. It writes the entry with the PR-time fields (`title`, `release_note`, `created_at`, `branch`, `author`, `co_authors`, `category`, `breaking`, `issues`) and empty placeholders for the rest. The entry merges to `main` with the feature PR and waits.
2. **Post-merge (in-repo):** the `changelog-enrich.yml` workflow (`mode: enrich`) resolves the just-merged PR and fills `merged_at`/`commit`/`pr`/`stats` via `changelog-core enrich`. Write-back pushes only `changelog/**` as `road-runner-bot[bot]` (ADR 0004). `mode: enrich` is the deploy-target mode: it does **not** stamp `version` (contrast the npm targets' `mode: finalise`) — the release-orchestrator owns the release cut, and `version` records the release an entry shipped in.

**CI validation:** the `lint` reusable caller runs `pnpm validate:changelog` (`pnpm exec changelog-core validate`) on every PR. Malformed entries fail the check. Run it locally with:

```bash
pnpm validate:changelog
```
