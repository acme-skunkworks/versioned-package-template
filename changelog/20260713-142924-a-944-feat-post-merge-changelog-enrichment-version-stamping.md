title: Add in-repo post-merge changelog enrichment
release_note: Merged changelog entries are now enriched in-repo on every push to main — no dependency on the release-orchestrator's changelog cron.

## Added

- Added a standalone `.github/workflows/changelog-enrich.yml` (on push to `main`,
  `mode: enrich`) calling shared-workflows' `reusable-changelog-enrich.yml`,
  modelled on the `octavo` / `shared-workflows` deploy-target exemplars ([A-944](https://linear.app/acme-skunkworks/issue/A-944)).
  It fills the post-merge changelog metadata — `merged_at`, `commit`, `pr`,
  `stats` — in-repo, writing back `changelog/**` as `road-runner-bot[bot]` via an
  App token (`secrets: inherit`; the repo's `Trunk` ruleset already lists
  road-runner-bot as an `always` bypass actor, so the path-scoped push is
  accepted — ADR 0004 / [A-794](https://linear.app/acme-skunkworks/issue/A-794)).

## Changed

- This replaces the enrich job that previously lived inside the now-deleted
  `pkg-release.yml` ([A-942](https://linear.app/acme-skunkworks/issue/A-942)), and needs no release-orchestrator cron — the central
  `enrich-changelogs.yml` was retired in [A-801](https://linear.app/acme-skunkworks/issue/A-801) when the estate moved enrichment
  in-repo. `mode: enrich` is the deploy-target mode: it does not stamp `version`
  into entries (the orchestrator owns the release cut), matching the canonical
  exemplars.
