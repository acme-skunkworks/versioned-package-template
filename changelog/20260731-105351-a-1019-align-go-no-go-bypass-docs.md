## Changed

- Dropped stale "npm-package template has no bot bypass" wording from README /
  CLAUDE.md / init-skill comments. Deploy targets already provision road-runner-bot
  on GO/NO GO (A-944); npm packages now need the same enricher bypass
  ([A-1019](https://linear.app/acme-skunkworks/issue/A-1019)) — documented as
  estate-wide rather than deploy-target-only.
