## Changed

- Replaced the npm publish workflow with the versioned **deploy-target** release
  model modelled on `octavo` / `shared-workflows` ([A-942](https://linear.app/acme-skunkworks/issue/A-942)). This archetype
  publishes no npm or GitHub package — it cuts versioned git tags + GitHub
  Releases only.

## Removed

- Deleted `.github/workflows/pkg-release.yml`. Deploy targets have **no** in-repo
  release/publish workflow: the release-orchestrator opens the release PR and
  cuts the git tag + GitHub Release directly. With no publish leg there is no
  `npm-release` environment and no OIDC, so the [A-326](https://linear.app/acme-skunkworks/issue/A-326) cross-boundary hardening
  drops away entirely — there is no mintable publish credential to fence.
- Dropped the now-dead `act:release:dry` package.json script (it drove the
  deleted `pkg-release.yml`), and de-referenced `pkg-release.yml` in the
  `dependabot.yml` grouping comment.

## Added

- `release-please-config.json` now carries the mandatory
  `group-pull-request-title-pattern`
  (`chore${scope}: release${component} ${version}`, [A-677](https://linear.app/acme-skunkworks/issue/A-677)) so a combined
  deploy-target release PR carries the version and actually cuts a tag, plus
  `bump-minor-pre-major` for the pre-1.0 template. `release-type: node`,
  `include-v-in-tag`, and `skip-changelog` are unchanged (the dated `changelog/`
  directory remains the only changelog).
