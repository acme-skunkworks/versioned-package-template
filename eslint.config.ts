/**
 * Self-lint config for the template, dogfooding the published Acme preset:
 * the `base` stack plus the TypeScript-file overrides.
 *
 * This is a content-only, non-npm baseline (A-939): there is no first-party
 * `src/` TypeScript to build or type-check, so the old src-spanning
 * `tsconfig.eslint.json` project pin is gone with the tsconfig trio. ESLint's
 * only lint surface here is the `infrastructure/` `.mjs` tooling; the two `.ts`
 * config files are excluded (`eslint.config.ts` by the preset's global ignores,
 * `vitest.config.ts` below) so the base preset's type-aware rules never look for
 * a tsconfig that no longer exists.
 *
 * Authored in TypeScript (loaded by jiti) and wrapped in `defineConfig` so the
 * whole config array is type-checked against the preset's shipped types.
